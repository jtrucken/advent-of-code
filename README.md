# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the puzzles in the annual **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** event. There are 25 programming puzzles in total, each divided into 2 parts. Each part completed awards a gold star, and the goal is to earn all 50 gold stars. That covers the code portion of the name. If you don't know what the advent portion of the name refers to, I recommend you check out the wikipedia article for [Advent Calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

I'm a mostly self-taught programmer, and I use programming for automation in my day job, but my profession is not that of a programmer, so if the solutions aren't as elegant as they could be, you'll have to forgive me. I participate in this event mostly for fun but also to keep my basic programming skills and concepts sharp. As a result, the programming languages I use may vary if I want to experiment with learning a new language. The languages I have used so far are:

-PowerShell

My first attempt at participation was in 2021, but I didn't get very far. The years I've participated in after are:
