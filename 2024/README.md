# Advent of Code 2024

These are my attempts at solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge for 2024. Each year, the challenge has a story that explains why we must earn all the gold stars for the puzzles. The story this year is:

> The *Chief Historian* is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
>
> As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a **star**. They figure the Chief Historian *must* be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get **fifty stars** on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.

So far, the language\(s\) I have used are:

- PowerShell

I have completed the following days:

- [x] [Day 01](./Day%2001/)
- [x] [Day 02](./Day%2002/)[^1]
- [x] [Day 03](./Day%2003/)
- [ ] [Day 04]()
- [ ] [Day 05]()
- [ ] [Day 06]()
- [ ] [Day 07]()

- [ ] [Day 21]()
- [ ] [Day 22]()
- [ ] [Day 23]()
- [ ] [Day 24]()
- [ ] [Day 25]()

[^1]: Although I have this day marked as complete, I never actually got my solution to produce the right answer for part 2. After much trial and error, I can get the output within an error of 1.
