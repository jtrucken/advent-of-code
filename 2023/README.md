# Advent of Code 2023

These are my attempts at solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge for 2023. Each year, the challenge has a story that explains why we must earn all the gold stars for the puzzles. The story this year is:

> Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
>
> You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

So far, the language\(s\) I have used are:

- PowerShell
